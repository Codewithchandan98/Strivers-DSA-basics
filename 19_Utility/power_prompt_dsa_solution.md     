Now convert the above explanation and solutions into a clean and 
structured markdown-style note suitable for pushing to GitHub.

Include:

- Problem title and description
- Sample input/output
- Edge cases
- Brute force, better, and optimal approaches:
    - Add headings for each
    - For brute and better: write code in Python and **comment out the entire code block**
    - For optimal: write a short explanation, clean Python code (not commented), and run/test cases
- A table comparing time and space complexity of all approaches
- Use markdown formatting with headers, code blocks, and bullet points
- Keep it clean and revision-friendly like a personal DSA notebook
